2024-10-28
   * Got Claude Sonnet's help to change the program to run on my machine.
        * Mostly changes to how it uses textual. Fixes setter and attribute errors.
        * Changed how the main program is called at the end, to align with 
          textual conventions


2024-10-29
   * Somehow accidentally UNDID some of the changes I made yesterday causing it to break.
        * Managed to restore the proper versions of tui000.py and progressbar.py that work.
   * Discovered an error when I pressed "O" for Options:
        * Error --> TypeError: object NoneType can't be used in 'await' expression
        * Solved the error (mostly) by removing the two "await" commands in action_debug
   * Slowed down the questions by changing set_interval from 10 to 12
   * Gave up on making a noCSS version as textual seems to prefer CSS (maybe there's a 
     way that I just don't know.
   * Reverted the speed back to 10.


2024-11-01
   * Refreshed my tinkering branch with Hunter's latest version which is now updated
     to a newer version of textual (and fixes all my initial problems).
   * This update to main is cleaner than my experimental fixes. I'm a little bummed
     I did all the work only to have Hunter do a better job at it, but I can at least 
     say it was a learning experience! That's what learning's all about!


2024-11-06
   * Refreshed my tinkering branch with Hunter's latest version which is now updated
     to a newer version of textual (and fixes all my initial problems).
   * But it's not responding to my keyboard input.
