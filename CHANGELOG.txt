   * Got Claude Sonnet's help to change the program to run on my machine.
        * Mostly changes to how it uses textual. Fixes setter and attribute errors.
        * Changed how the main program is called at the end, to align with 
          textual conventions


2024-10-29
   * Somehow accidentally UNDID some of the changes I made yesterday causing it to break.
        * Managed to restore the proper versions of tui000.py and progressbar.py that work.
   * Discovered an error when I pressed "O" for Options:
        * Error --> TypeError: object NoneType can't be used in 'await' expression
        * Solved the error (mostly) by removing the two "await" commands in action_debug
   * Slowed down the questions by changing set_interval from 10 to 12
